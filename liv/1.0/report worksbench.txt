mysqldump.exe is version 5.7.12, but the MySQL Server to be dumped has version 5.7.17.
Because the version of mysqldump is older than the server, some features may not be backed up properly.
It is recommended you upgrade your local MySQL client programs, including mysqldump, to a version equal to or newer than that of the target server.
The path to the dump tool must then be set in Preferences -> Administrator -> Path to mysqldump Tool:
10:39:00 Dumping workshapedb (all tables)
Running: mysqldump.exe --defaults-file="c:\users\benoit\appdata\local\temp\tmpmsawsi.cnf"  --user=workshape --host=workshape-pc --protocol=tcp --port=3306 --default-character-set=utf8 --single-transaction=TRUE --routines --skip-triggers "workshapedb"
10:39:00 Export of C:\Users\BENOIT\Documents\dumps\Dump20170527.sql has finished
